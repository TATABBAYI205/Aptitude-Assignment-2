Given data:-

The town has 1000 inhabitants.
60% of them are males, so 0.60 * 1000 = 600 people are males.
This means the remaining 1000 - 600 = 400 people are females.
25% of all inhabitants are literate, so 0.25 * 1000 = 250 people are literate.
The question asks what percentage of females are literate. To find this, we first need to determine how many literate people are females.

We know that 250 people in total are literate. But this includes both males and females. We're told that 20% of males are literate, so 0.20 * 600 = 120 males are literate.

This means that the rest of the literate people must be females. So, the number of literate females is 250 (total literate people) - 120 (literate males) = 130.

So, the percentage of females that are literate is (130 literate females / 400 total females) * 100% = 32.5%.
