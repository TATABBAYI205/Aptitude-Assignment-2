The percentage of candidates that passed in English or Mathematics is given by the sum of the individual passing percentages minus the percentage that passed in both.

So, the percentage that passed in either English or Mathematics is:

80% (English) + 85% (Mathematics) - 73% (both) = 92%.

Therefore, the percentage of candidates who passed at least one subject is 92%.

This means that 100% - 92% = 8% of candidates failed in both subjects.
