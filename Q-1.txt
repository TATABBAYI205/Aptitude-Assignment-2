 Given data:-

First, we need to find the amount of water that the inlet pipe can fill in an hour. Since the inlet pipe fills at a rate of 4 litres per minute, it can fill 4 * 60 = 240 litres in an hour.

Now, let's consider the tank capacity as X litres.

The leak can empty the tank in 6 hours, which means the leak rate is X/6 litres per hour.

The inlet pipe and the leak together can empty the tank in 8 hours. So, in an hour, they can fill X/8 litres. But we know that the inlet pipe alone can fill 240 litres per hour. So, the leak must drain away the rest, which is 240 - X/8 litres per hour.

These two leak rates must be the same, so we equate them:

X/6 = 240 - X/8

Multiplying everything by 24 to clear the fractions, we get:

4X = 5760 - 3X

Solving for X gives:

7X = 5760

So, X = 5760 / 7 = 824 litres (approximately).

So, the capacity of the tank is around 824 litres.
